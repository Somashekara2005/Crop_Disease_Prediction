# 🌾 Smart Agriculture Assistant  
### *Crop Recommendation • Fertilizer Suggestion • Plant Disease Detection*

---

## 📌 Overview  
Smart Agriculture Assistant is a machine-learning–powered web application that helps farmers make informed decisions for better yield and healthier crops. The project integrates three major agricultural intelligence modules:

1. **Crop Recommendation** – Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrient values and weather conditions.  
2. **Fertilizer Recommendation** – Suggests the right fertilizer by comparing soil nutrient content with optimal crop requirements.  
3. **Plant Disease Detection** – Uses deep learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images and provide background info & cure suggestions.

This system is built to support sustainable agriculture and empower farmers through data-driven insights.

## 🌱 Motivation  
Agriculture is a cornerstone of economic growth, especially in countries like India where a major portion of the population relies on farming for their livelihood.  
With the rise of modern technologies like **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, agriculture can be made more efficient and productive.

This project aims to:  
- Help farmers increase yield  
- Reduce resource waste  
- Detect diseases early  
- Make expert-level insights easily accessible
